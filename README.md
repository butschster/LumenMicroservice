# Lumen Microservice
![heading](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/773481/96422465-b6bbe800-1200-11eb-914a-8c2c150d80eb.jpg)

This Package helps you to use Lumen framework as a microservice through AMQP without extra knowledge. 
Just install package, create Exchange Point class and start exchanging information between services through RabbitMQ.

For serialization this package uses JMS\Serializer.

P.S. You can use this service for testing https://www.cloudamqp.com. They have free plan.

## Requirements
- Lumen 7.x to 8.x
- PHP 7.4 and above
   
## Installation and Configuration
From the command line run

`composer require butschster/lumen-microservice`

#### Register Service provider
```php
$app->register(Butschster\Exchanger\Providers\ExchangeServiceProvider::class);
```

#### Copy configs from package `config` directory to your Lumen app and register them.

```php
$app->configure('amqp');
$app->configure('microservice');
```

#### Add variables to your .env file
```
MICROSERVICE_NAME=...
MICROSERVICE_VERSION=1.0.0
RABBITMQ_HOST=...
RABBITMQ_USERNAME=...
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=...
RABBITMQ_VHOST=...
```


#### Create exchange point in your app
This point will use for receiving request from other services and for sending responses.

```php
namespace App\Exchange\Point;

use Butschster\Exchanger\Contracts\Exchange\Point as PointContract;

class Point implements PointContract
{
    public function getName(): string
    {
        return 'com.test';
    }

    /**
     * // subject: com.test.action.test
     * @subject action.test
     */
    public function testSubject(IncomingRequest $request, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $logger->info(
            sprintf('info [%s]:', $request->getSubject()),
            [$payload]
        );

        // Response
        $payload = new ...;
        $request->sendResponse($payload);
    }

    /**
     * // subject: com.test.action.test1
     * @subject action.test1
     */
    public function anotherTestSubject(IncomingRequest $request, LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $payload = new ...;
        $request->sendResponse($payload);
    }
}
```

Then register this point

```php
use App\Exchange\Point;
use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;
use Butschster\Exchanger\Contracts\Exchange\Point as PointContract;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        $this->app->singleton(PointContract::class, Point::class);
    }
}
```

#### Register console command
```php
use Butschster\Exchanger\Console\Commands\RunMicroservice;

class Kernel extends ConsoleKernel
{
    protected $commands = [
        RunMicroservice::class
    ];
}
```

#### Runnig microservice
This single command will run your microservice and start listening to commands registered in your exchange point.  

`php artisan service:run`

Supervisor is a process monitor for the Linux operating system, and will automatically restart your horizon process if it fails.
To install Supervisor on Ubuntu, you may use the following command:

`sudo apt-get install supervisor`

Supervisor configuration files are typically stored in the /etc/supervisor/conf.d directory. 
Within this directory, you may create any number of configuration files that instruct supervisor how your processes should be monitored.
For example, let's create a microservice.conf file that starts and monitors a process:

```
[program:microservice]
process_name=%(program_name)s
command=php /var/www/app.com/artisan service:run
autostart=true
autorestart=true
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/var/www/app.com/storage/logs/microservice.log
stopwaitsecs=3600
```

Once the configuration file has been created, you may update the Supervisor configuration and start the processes using the following commands:

```
sudo supervisorctl reread

sudo supervisorctl update

sudo supervisorctl start microservice
```

#### Sending requests
For requesting information from another service you should use `ExchangeManager`

```php
use Butschster\Exchanger\Contracts\ExchangeManager;

class UserController {

    public function getUser(ExchangeManager $manager, int $userId)
    {
        $request = new GetUserByIdPayload();
        $request->userId = $userId;

        $user = $manager->request('com.test.action.test', $request);
        ...
    }

}
```

#### Broadcasting
If you want to send event to all services you should use `ExchangeManager`

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Butschster\Exchanger\Contracts\ExchangeManager;

class UserController {

    public function update(ExchangeManager $manager, Request $request, User $user)
    {
        $payload = new UserPayload();
        $data = $request->validate(...);
        $user->update($data);

        $payload->id = $user->id;
        $payload->username = $user->username;
        ...
        
        $manager->broadcast('com.user.event.updated', $payload);
    }

}
```
